          "Only two weeks before moving to the US, I had no place to live, until Ron took me in, and it was possibly the best thing that could've happened to me. My two years there were filled with so many great times, struggles, and laughter; a little bit of everything, and I would've neved lived those moments if it wasn't for the home Ron made out of his homestay. Now, all those people, including Ron, are my family."</p>

            "There are too many reasons why I love uncle Ronnie's house. One of them is the friendly environment of this house. Every person who lives in the house is from a different culture, a different background, and a different race, but no one finds it hard to interact with the other people, because everyone is curious to learn other cultures."</p>
