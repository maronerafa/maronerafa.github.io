      <h1 class="title">Ronald Taylor</h1>
      <p>"Uncle Ronnie's is a progressive international house that houses students from all over the world. Unlike most other
        homestays, our homestay is located in the inner city area of Chicago, giving students an opportunity to interact with
        people from 6 to 7 different countries at a time as well as locals. Finally, Uncle Ronnie's is about family,
        because people that stay at Uncle Ronnie's become family not just to local students or those who live in the house,
        but those who have moved back to their countries as well, forming bonds across cultures."</p>
